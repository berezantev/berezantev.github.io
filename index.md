# Abstract and Objectives


 {: style="text-align: justify" } 
 Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic, personal, and social equality of the sexes. Somehow, to this day there are many in the Western society that shy away from defining themselves as pro-feminists, and many even oppose it. In fact, feminism is still a very controversial and politicized topic.

 {: style="text-align: justify" } 
 In this project, we aim to shed a light on the evolution of feminism between 2015 and 2020 and its relation with the media, using the [Quotebank](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.YbEcOWZKj0o) dataset. In particular, we would like to analyze the media coverage that feminism is receiving, both in terms of volume and sentiment. Furthermore, we will try to understand whether feminism is also being applied in practice by each media outlet.

The dataset used for our analysis is the Quotebank dataset that consists of 178 million unique, speaker-attributed quotations that were extracted from 196 million English news articles. As the investigated topic is feminism, some related quotes are extracted by making use of key words such as "feminism", "patriarchy", "sexism", "misogyny", "misandry", "gynocentrism",  "rape culture", "slut shaming", "women’s rights", "toxic masculinity", etc.

Below is a representation of the words present in the 20052 quotes obtained. As the size is proportional to the frequency, we notice that these quotes are mostly about women and men, people's opinions ("think") and some recurrent feminism related sub-topics ("sexism", "patriarchy", "misogyny").
